# Basic Python CLI
An ultra basic Python CLI example with no frameworks or dependencies. In just a few minutes you can have all you need to create a super simple, single-file Python CLI tool without any external dependencies or frameworks.

## Watch the Video tutorial

## What you will learn

Build a very simple command line tool with Python without using external dependencies or frameworks. In this video you'll see how with just a few lines of Python you can transform a file into a script with a help menu.

Although you can create more powerful command-line tools with other frameworks like argparse or external libraries like Click, you can still implement a quick script without them that includes a help menu

## Why would you want to do this
Because you need something very quick, easy to run, ideally with a single argument, and most of the time for other systems to use. No need for fancy help menus (although you can add those), and hopefully with a single task to do.

## Next steps
Now that you know how to do this minimal Python CLI tool, you can try out other frameworks like Python's `argparse` module or the Click framework. I have examples and guides for [argparse CLI tools](https://github.com/alfredodeza/argparse-python-cli) and for [using the Click framework](https://github.com/alfredodeza/click-python-cli).
